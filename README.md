This project is focused on designing and implementing a secure, user-friendly authentication system, providing users with a personalized experience upon successful login. The system is intended to authenticate users by verifying their usernames and passwords and, upon successful verification, present a virtual bank card styled with CSS that contains user-specific information.



For your authentication system project, here are the essential tools and technologies you would need to build and deploy a secure, functional, and visually appealing application:

1. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
Purpose: HTML is the foundational language for creating web pages. It provides the structure of the application, defining elements like forms, input fields, buttons, and containers.
Usage in Project: HTML will be used to create the login page, where users enter their username and password. After successful authentication, HTML also structures the page displaying the CSS-styled virtual bank card with the userâ€™s information.

3. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
Purpose: CSS is used for styling and layout. It allows for creating visually appealing designs and can be used to give the bank card a realistic look.
Usage in Project: CSS will style the login form to enhance user experience and create a visually engaging bank card that looks like a real one, with gradients, shadows, and precise layouts. CSS transitions and animations can also be applied for smooth visual effects, making the interface more dynamic.
