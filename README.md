This project is centered around designing and implementing a secure, user-friendly authentication system that provides a personalized user experience upon successful login. The system verifies users' credentials—specifically their usernames and passwords—and, once authenticated, presents a virtual bank card styled with CSS. This card displays user-specific information, offering a visually engaging experience.

Technologies Used:
The following tools and technologies were used to develop and deploy a secure, functional, and visually appealing application:

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)

Purpose: HTML serves as the foundational language for web page creation. It structures the content and defines the elements, such as forms, input fields, buttons, and containers.
Usage in Project: HTML is used to create the login page where users input their credentials. Upon successful authentication, HTML structures the page to display the CSS-styled virtual bank card, which contains personalized user information.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

Purpose: CSS is responsible for styling and layout, enabling the creation of visually appealing designs. It can be used to give the virtual bank card a realistic appearance, with features like gradients, shadows, and precise layouts.
Usage in Project: CSS is used to enhance the design of the login form, improving user experience, as well as styling the virtual bank card. It incorporates transitions and animations for smooth visual effects, making the user interface dynamic and engaging.
